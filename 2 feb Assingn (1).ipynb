    "Question 1-Explain 'with' an example each when to use a 'for' loop and when to use 'while' loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-Both 'for' loops and 'while' loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain \n",

    "Use a 'for' loop when:\n",
    "\n",
    "You know in advance how many times you want to execute the loop. In this case, you can use a\n",
    "for loop to iterate over a sequence of elements such as a list, tuple, or range object.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Print the numbers from 1 to 10\n",

    "    print(i)\n",
